# ADR-0001 — Wails v2 now, v3 as a contained migration

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-06-19

## Context

Wails v3 is the framework's future (GTK4 on Linux, better bindings) but is still
on the alpha line as of mid-2026 (`v3.0.0-alpha.96`), not a tagged stable
release. Wails v2 is the stable, battle-tested production line.

## Decision

Build on Wails v2. Confine all Wails runtime calls behind a thin internal
`shell` package that depends on *our* interface. The v3 migration then touches
`app/` and `shell/`, not the core.

## Consequences

A little indirection now; near-zero core churn when v3 stabilizes. Revisit when
v3 cuts a stable tag.
